# PCA (version 1.0)

## Parameters 

`parameters` should contain:

- `num_hvgs`: a scalar integer containing the number of highly variable genes to use to compute the PCA.
- `num_pcs`: a scalar integer containing the number of PCs to compute.

## Results

`results` should contain:

- `pcs`: a 2-dimensional float dataset containing the PC coordinates in a row-major layout.
  Each row corresponds to a cell (after QC filtering) and each column corresponds to a PC.
  Note that this is deliberately transposed from the Javascript/Wasm representation for easier storage.
