# Inputs (version 2.0)

## Parameters

See the "Parameters" section for [version 1.1](v1_1.md).

## Results

`results` should contain:

- `num_cells`: an integer scalar specifying the number of cells in the loaded dataset.
- `num_features`: a group containing integer scalar datasets, each named after a modality (typically `"RNA"` and/or `"ADT"`).
  Each dataset contains the number of features for its named modality.
  When dealing with multiple matrix inputs, the number of features is defined as the intersection across all matrices.
- `identities`: a group containin 1-dimensional integer datasets, each named after a modality in `num_features`.
  Each dataset is of length equal to the number of features listed in its corresponding `num_features` dataset.
  Each dataset contains the identities of the rows in the loaded dataset corresponding to its named modality.
  If a single input was provided, `identities` identifies each row in terms of its index in the "original" input matrix (i.e., if it were loaded without any modification).
  If multiple inputs were provided, `identities` contains the intersection of features across inputs, and each value refers to the row index in the original matrix of the _first_ input.
  Row identities are parallel to the per-feature results in subsequent analysis steps.
